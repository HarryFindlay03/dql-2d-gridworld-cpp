# dql-2d-gridworld-cpp

This is a repository containing all the cpp code for a deep-Q-learning reinforcement learning agent to learn how to find some 'food' in a 2D gridworld environment.

This is built all from scratch in c++ utilising only the Eigen linear algebra library for the matrix multiplications found within the multi-layer perceptron network (a.k.a. neural network a.k.a. deep neural network).

Please feel free to do whatever you want with this code, for me this has been a helpful project to fine tune the algorithms and implementation for use within some slightly more serious dissertation work applying the same methods found here to compiler optimisation (coming soon!).

Thanks, Harry ðŸ•º
